17:30 Installation of 2020.3.36f Ended. Previous one was not starting project.
18:00 Existing code read and kind of understood main things.
18:10 Will implement a rotating object that should reset after each connection and start rotating in all connected devices at same time, after X seconds.
18:30 Basic logic implemented. Testing using public vars done.
19:20 Added basic logic using NetManager methods, delegates to receive responses from server.
19:40 Tried to do some minor real test before using multiple devices. 

As starting a simple server that can keep all connections is out of test document, and no further instructions were given. I end test here.
Around 3h time spent. Thanks for the time.
